# ToDo List App

## Input
The user launches the site and will be prompted to either add to the list or delete since 3 tasks will already be loaded once the page loads.
When the user inputs the task they will then click "Add Task" which will add to the bottom of the list. When the user clicks "Delete" the task will be removed from the list
and not be visible anymore. Each task that gets add will have a "Delete" button next to it and will only remove that task when clicked.

## Process
The app uses the **useState** hook to maintain the list of tasks dynamically. When a user enters a task and clicks the "Add Task!" button, the application updates the state by appending the new task. If a user clicks the "Delete" button, the task next to the delete button is removed from the state. The tasks are rendered using the **.map()** function, ensuring that the ToDo List App remains updated whenever the state changes.

## Output
The tasks are displayed in a structured list format, styled using **todolistCSS.css** which is located in a folder named "components". Each task appears inside a styled container with an associated delete button. When a task is added, it will appears in the list with a "Delete" button next to it, and when the "Deleted" button is clicked, it is removed instantly.
